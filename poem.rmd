## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,         
And sorry I could not travel both         
And be one traveler, long I stood       
And looked down one as far as I could     
To where it bent in the undergrowth;      

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,     
      Shining with all his might:   
He did his very best to make    
      The billows smooth and bright —     
And this was odd, because it was    
      The middle of the night.     

The moon was shining sulkily,      
      Because she thought the sun    
Had got no business to be there    
      After the day was done —     
"It's very rude of him," she said,       
      "To come and spoil the fun."       

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In twilight's gentle, whispered grace,  
Where stars begin their slow embrace,  
The moon ascends with silver light,  
And day surrenders to the night.

The world in shades of twilight blue,  
Unfolds its dreams in velvet hue,  
The winds converse in soft, hushed tones,  
As shadows dance on ancient stones.

The trees, they sway in rhythmic dance,  
Their leaves a whisper, soft romance,  
And in the air, a fragrance light,  
Of jasmine blooms and summer’s night.

A river's song, both sweet and deep,  
In twilight's hush begins to weep,  
It tells of journeys far and wide,  
And secrets that the night confides.

The stars above, in patterns old,  
Map out the tales of lives untold,  
While constellations softly weave  
The stories that the night conceived.

In this serene and fleeting hour,  
Time seems to pause and gently flower,  
And all the world, in twilight's span,  
Finds peace within the evening's hand.
