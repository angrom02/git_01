   As he landed his crew with care;           
Supporting each man on the top of the tide        
   By a finger entwined in his hair.        

"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:

In twilight's gentle, whispered grace,  
Where stars begin their slow embrace,  
The moon ascends with silver light,  
And day surrenders to the night.

The world in shades of twilight blue,  
Unfolds its dreams in velvet hue,  
The winds converse in soft, hushed tones,  
As shadows dance on ancient stones.

The trees, they sway in rhythmic dance,  
Their leaves a whisper, soft romance,  
And in the air, a fragrance light,  
Of jasmine blooms and summerâ€™s night.

A river's song, both sweet and deep,  
In twilight's hush begins to weep,  
It tells of journeys far and wide,  
And secrets that the night confides.

The stars above, in patterns old,  
Map out the tales of lives untold,  
While constellations softly weave  
The stories that the night conceived.

In this serene and fleeting hour,  
Time seems to pause and gently flower,  
And all the world, in twilight's span,  
Finds peace within the evening's hand.
